                       oh gee that is just so clever. I mean, how does one even
                       go about coming up with things like that?
14:11 &lt; ramphi10&gt; I don't get it...
14:11 &lt; also_pope&gt; i get it
14:12 &lt;@Pyro&gt; 4:20.
14:15 &lt; false_rompler&gt; ramphi10: 4:20 is how stoners signify which part of the
                       weed array should be smoked first. Weed[0:3] being
                       considered holy in there religon. so weed[4:20] is 16
                       pots which when divided by the first number of pots
                       accessed is that number, 4. Quite the numerologists eh?
14:15 &lt; false_rompler&gt; 20 also being signifigant as the average age when they
                       move into their parents basement.

14:31 &lt; ramphi10&gt; false_rompler: on teh irc via teh cygwins
14:32 &lt; ramphi10&gt; So these weed arrays, are they statically allocated then?
14:34 &lt; false_rompler&gt; no. They are genreally accessed once and then freed.
                       They are malloc'd more often in the college function
14:37 &lt; ramphi10&gt; woah
14:50 &lt; also_pope&gt; i get it
14:50 &lt; also_pope&gt; oh
14:50 &lt; also_pope&gt; wait no i don't get it
14:57 &lt; ramphi10&gt; but if the whole array is freed, then how do they get so much
                  holy weed all the time?
15:22 &lt; false_rompler&gt; well they're python programmers, so they just loose the
                       reference to weed[4:20] and garbage collection takes
                       care of the rest
